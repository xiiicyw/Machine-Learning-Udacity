# Final Project: Enron Corporate Fraud Person of Interest Detector

<h3>Project Preview</h3>

•	Built a POI identifier, which can correctly classify the POIs with approximately 80% accuracy, using Python scikit-learn.

•	The identifier was able to execute feature engineering (KBest, PCA), generate new features, implement algorithms (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression) and tune the parameters using the best estimator automatically found by grid-search cross-validation.

The POI identifier code is stored in final_project/poi_id.py
